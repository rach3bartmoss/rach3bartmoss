## Hi there 👋

 ⚡ About me ⚡

🎓 I am Douglas Alves, a student at 42porto School, currently living in the vibrant city of Porto, Portugal, also known as Invicta, the city that has never been defeated.  I have interrest in learning and growing my skills in various programming languages, with a particular interest in **C** and **Rust**.

📝 I'm currently working on the **Common Core Projects** from the 42 Curriculum, which are primarily written in **C** and **C++**. In addition to my school projects, I'm also working on a solo project: a 🎵**music player written in Rust**.🎵

🌴 Besides the code world, I'm trying to be a avid reader, with a penchant for **Russian literature** and the **cyberpunk genre**. These narratives fuel my imagination and resilience to inspire my coding projects. Beyond my school projects, I have a unique hobby: restore vintage devices. From restoring old trinitron Sony TVs to revamping vinyl players, I find joy in preserving the past and making it relevant for the present. 🌴

🏄 Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project or chat about Blade Runner films and Cyberpunk games or even play a chess match. 🏄

I'm reachable via instagram: **@asap_dougl** 📷 and email: **douglaspf_alves@outlook.com** 📨
