## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 âš¡ About me âš¡

 ðŸŽ“ I am Douglas Alves, current student at renowned 42porto School, currently living in the vibrant city of Porto,
Portugal, also known as Invicta, the city that has never been defeated.  I have interrest in learning and growing my skills in various programming languages, with a particular interest in **C** and **Rust**.

I'm currently working on the **Common Core Projects** from the 42 Curriculum, which are primarily in **C**. In addition to my school projects, I'm also working on a solo project: a ðŸŽµ**music player written in Rust**.ðŸŽµ

Besides the code world, I'm an wannabe avid reader, with a penchant for **Russian literature** and the **cyberpunk genre**. These narratives fuel my imagination and resilience to inspire my coding projects. Beyond mt school projects, I have a unique hobby: restore vintage devices. From restoring old trinitron Sony TVs to revamping vinyl players, I find joy in preserving the past and making it relevant for the present.

Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project or chat about Blade Runner films and Cyberpunk games or even play a chess match.
