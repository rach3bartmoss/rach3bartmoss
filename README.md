## Welcome

 💫 About me

🎓 I am Douglas Alves, a student at 42School, currently living in Portugal. I admire how software works in its deepest layers and the marvelous things we can do with it! My current stack is C, C++, Python and Rust. I am willing to collaborate on projects where I can make a difference!

📝 I'm currently working on the **Common Core Projects** from the 42 Curriculum, which are primarily written in **C** and **C++**.

🏄 Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project
